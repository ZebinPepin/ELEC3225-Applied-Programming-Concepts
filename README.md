<!-- Welcome to our GitHub repository for Assignment 2! In this repository, we have created a collaborative space for a group of 2 students work together on their process models. Each team member has uploaded their three process models, labeled as "Lastname_ModelUsed" for easy identification.

To facilitate teamwork and version control, we have utilized GitHub as our preferred platform. GitHub provides a seamless environment for collaborative coding, sharing files, and tracking changes. It ensures that all team members have access to the latest versions of the process models and allows for efficient collaboration.

To ensure active participation and knowledge sharing, each team member has checked out their teammates' files, made edits, and then committed the changes. This iterative process enables everyone to contribute their insights and suggestions to each process model, resulting in a well-rounded and refined set of models.

We believe that utilizing GitHub for version control and collaboration greatly enhances our efficiency and enables us to effectively manage our project. It provides transparency, accountability, and a streamlined workflow for our team. -->
